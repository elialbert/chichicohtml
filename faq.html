<h2>FAQ</h2>
<p>
<u><b>
Can ChiChiCo do childcare for my organization's events?
</u></b>
<br/>
We generally prioritize event requests from organizations that are grassroots (member-led) and can't afford to hire an awesome childcare professional.  We seek partnerships with organizations that focus on racial and economic justice.  We like to have at least 30 days notice to plan properly and make sure we have enough available volunteers to safely cover the event.  For more info, and to fill out an event request form, click <a href="/request">here</a>! 
</p>
<p>
<u><b>
What do I have to do to become a member of ChiChiCo and start volunteering?
</u></b>
<br/>
All our volunteers go through training before they can participate in childcare.  Click <a href="/volunteer">here</a> to find out more.

<u><b>
Are there other ways to support ChiChiCo besides becoming a volunteer?
</u></b>
<br/>
Yes!  We can use your help to spread the word - if you know people that would like to volunteer, or activists whose work could benefit from childcare volunteers, please tell them to get in touch with us. We can also accept donations of money, children's books, or art materials. E-mail us at chichildcareco@gmail.com for more details.
</p>

<u><b>
I'm not that experienced working with kids. What support do volunteers get to help them be successful?
</u></b>
<br/>
In addition to the initial training, new volunteers are paired up with an experienced core volunteer who can provide ongoing support and answer questions.  We always do childcare as a team of no less than two, so you won't be on your own.  We also run occasional fun training activities for current volunteers, so that we can all learn new games and art activities to share with the kids.  
</p>
<p>
<u><b>
Have you ever done any social-justice youth programming?
</u></b>
<br/>
Usually, our childcare plan includes lots of fun and creative activities to keep kids engaged and happy while their parents are leading powerful social and economic justice campaigns.  When requested, we have helped plan social justice activities for youth, always in partnership with the organization that is hosting the event.
